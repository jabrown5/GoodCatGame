    <h5>It's your choice. Will you be a good cat? Or a bad cat?</h5>
    <p id="game-description">Your mission: to get through the day being as good of a cat as possible. Your human is away for the next 8 hours so you get 8 chances to prove how good you are. But hey, being bad can be fun too. And everyone knows, your human is going to love you anyway. Investigate the room for objects to interact with!</p>

      <p>You're an orange and white fella with a knack for trouble and just can't help being naughty sometimes. Your reputation is not the greatest so you don't have a large cache of pre-existing good cat points. The expectations are low so any good behavior is memorable! <br><b>Good Cat Points: 10</b></p>

      <h5>Bennett</h5>
      <p>If naughtiness was limited to the kitchen and food, you'd be the worst cat ever! You steal tidbits, rip apart containers, and will stop at nothing for mayonnaise. Other than that, you're pretty average on the naughty scale. <br><b>Good Cat Points: 25</b></p>

      <h5>Lewis</h5>
      <p>You're a really good boy and rarely cause trouble. You prefer to be a clown and make everyone laugh. But when you're bad, it's shockingly unlike you. But you still get to ride your reputation as a good boy and no one takes you being a bad cat on occassion that seriously.<br><b>Good Cat Points: 40</b></p>
